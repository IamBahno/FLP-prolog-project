## üß† Solution

The Rubik‚Äôs cube is represented using the following predicate:

```prolog
cube([F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6,F7,F8,F9],   % Front
     [R1,R2,R3,R4,R5,R6,R7,R8,R9],   % Right
     [B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,B7,B8,B9],   % Back
     [L1,L2,L3,L4,L5,L6,L7,L8,L9],   % Left
     [U1,U2,U3,U4,U5,U6,U7,U8,U9],   % Up
     [D1,D2,D3,D4,D5,D6,D7,D8,D9]    % Down
)
```
Each face of the cube contains 9 values, where each value is a number from 1 to 6 representing a color.

This representation allows convenient access to individual pieces as well as entire faces. I can shorten the notation to `cube(F, R, B, L, U, D)` when working with whole faces.


#### Algorithm: Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
I used Iterative Deepening Search (IDS) to explore the solution space efficiently.

The algorithm works by setting a MaxDepth limit and then iteratively increasing the depth at which the cubes are explored. For each depth `D`, i generates all possible sequences of moves of length `D`, applies each move sequence to the input cube, and checks whether the resulting cube is solved.

If a solution is found, the corresponding sequence of moves is returned.

#### Efficiency
This approach is very memory-efficient, as nothing is stored in memory ‚Äî neither intermediate cubes nor move sequences. Surprisingly, the performance is even better than BFS in practice.

While IDS requires performing `D` rotations of the original cube for each move sequence of length `D` (at depth `D`), compared to just one rotation of the parent cube in BFS, the rotations themselves are not computationally expensive. In contrast, managing a large number of cubes in memory, as BFS does, introduces significant overhead.

#### No Tree Structure
Technically, I don‚Äôt even use a tree structure. Instead, I directly explore all the possible move sequences of a given length. This eliminates the need to expand nodes at intermediate levels, as is typically done in a traditional IDS implementation.
